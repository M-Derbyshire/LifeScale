# LifeScale

This is a front-end for a concept web application. It was created with ReactJS, TypeScript and Sass (As this is a front-end project, the back-end has been mocked with JSON-Server.).

LifeScale is a web application that allows users to get certain parts of their lives in better balance.

Users can create scales (for their work/life balance, or their food intake, for example), and then add different categories for those scales. The user will set a desired weight on each of those categories, so they can always see what their desired balance looks like on the scale's main page.

They can then create actions within each of those categories (so in a work/life balance scale, examples might be “employment”, “personal work”, “TV”), and then set an actual weight for each.

Then, from the scale's main page, they can record these actions in their lives, and work towards getting their current balance to match their desired balance.

**You can find the user/developer guides for this application in the */documentation* directory.**

**Please Note:** The MockJSONServerUserService class should not be taken as an example of how an IUserService class should be implemented. It exists for demonstration purposes, to allow the front-end to interact with a JSON Server back-end.
